# Python--IBRD-Loan-Activity
This Python-based project, which is part of the CareerFoundry Data Analysis course, exemines IBRD loans to gain insights into geographical trends in lending.
# Objective
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) contributes to the World Bank Group's mission by lending money to the governments of its poorer members in order to improve their economies and people's standard of living.
Exploratory visal analysis was performed to identify relationships between variables, examine geographical trends to identify the regions that are financed the most by IBRD through loans, and examine the types of loans.

# The steps of the Analysis
- Analysis has been conducted using Jupyter notebooks and the Anaconda libraries manager.
- Analysis has been conducted using Python and relevant libraries (pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, and seaborn).
- Descriptive checks have been conducted after importation of data.
- Data has been cleaned. Duplicate data, missing data, and mixed-type columns have been checked and addressed.
- Exploratory analysis has been conducted through visualizations in Jupyter notebook(scatterplots, correlation heatmaps, pair plots and categorical plots).
- Geospatial analysis using a GeoJSONfile has been conducted in Jupyter notebook.
- Regression,Cluster  and Time-series analysis have been conducted in Jupyter notebook.
- Analysis narrative and final results have been presented in a Tableau dashboard. 

# Recommendations 
The IBRD should focus its attention in countries where it is less active, such as Haiti, Togo, and Burundi.

A more in-depth analysis should be performed to determine the following:
- The impact of project type on the Original Principal Amount.
- An impact of the country's economical situation on the Interest Rate.
- Additionally, it would be beneficial to forecast Interest Rates.
